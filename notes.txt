rails new garageio
cd garageio
git init
git add -A
git status
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
git status (should say: working status clean)


rails generate model car make:string model:string year:string (one model per table)
rake db:migrate (tells DB to make/setup the table)
rails console 
Rails.env
Car
Car.all
Car.first
Car.create({ make: 'Tesla', model: 'Roadster', year: 2014})
Car.last
cars = Car.all
cars
cars.each do |car|
puts car.make
end

cars.each do |car|
puts car['make']
end

Car.create({make: 'Toyota', model: 'Corolla', year: 2011})
Car.last
exit

<right click delete that .rb file in db>

<open migration file in db/migrate and add string: name>
look at schema.db to verify
Car.create({ make: 'Toyota', model: 'Corolla', year: 2011, name: 'Gloria'})

rails console
reload!
exit

rails generate model motorcycle make:string model:string mileage:integer engine:string year:integer
rake db:migrate
rails console

Motorcycle.create( {make:'BMW', model:'R1200', mileage:5188, engine: "1170cc", year:2009, })
begin transaction
commit transaction

select "cars".* from "cars" where "cars"."id" = ? limit 1 [["ID", 1]]

CARS.UPDATE({YEAR:2001})
Car.update({'year'=>2001})
begin transaction
commit transaction
Car.inspect

rails server

<edit config/routes.rb>
Rails.application.routes.draw do (routes.rb)
  get '/cars' ==> 'cars#index'
end

class CarsController < Application::Base (in cars_controller.rb)
{
	def index
      @cars = Car.all
	end
}

create views/cars/index.html.erb
<h2>Cars</h2>
<ul>
	<%= @cars.each do |car| %>
	  <%= car.inspect %>
	  <li><%= car.make %> <%= car.model %></li>
	<% end %>
</ul>

layout file, add <h1>Welcome to GarageIO</h1> 
between body tags

getbootstrap.com/getting-started
copy/paste bootstrap CDN in layout file in app/views/layouts/applications.html.erb


[
class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
end
]


migration file --> instructions (migration files actually changes the DB)
schema --> result (helps you see what the DB looks like; don't delete the schema)
